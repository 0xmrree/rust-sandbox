A Rust binary is simply a compiled executable program created from a crate that contains a main() function. When you run cargo build or cargo run, Rust compiles the code into machine code for the current operating system, meaning a binary built on Linux runs on Linux, one built on Windows runs on Windows, and so on. Because binaries are specific to the platform they were compiled for, Rust supports targets, which define the OS and CPU architecture a binary is built for. You can install additional targets with rustup target add <target-name> (for example, rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu), then compile for them with cargo build --target <target-name>. With this setup, a developer can build executables for multiple environments from one system, allowing cross-compilation for Linux, macOS, Windows, and other architectures without switching machines.
